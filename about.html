    Mental Math is a simple platform to help you become faster at mental arithmetic. It pushes addition, subtraction,
    or multiplication problems in sets of ten and times your progress through the set. You can keep track of

      <p class="right">For the past few years, I have worked as a Mechanical Engineer. Noticing how most machines are automated with a screen as a user interface, I decided to take action to enhance my skill set in computer programming. I now have extensive training for the technology industry and am working on several 
        side projects in my free time, including functional web-based applications. I am always looking 
        to develop my skills, add them to my engineering background, and transfer them to real-world 
        applications.</p>
